Welcome! You just accepted your EDIC PhD offer, what's next?

In your first year, you will get used to doing research, and are not expected to be fully productive yet. In most fields, you will probably not publish a paper in your first year.
It's all about showing that you _can_ do it.
Depending on your lab, you may or may not have an office yet, but you should anyway hang out in the common room ([INR 012](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==INR%20012) and adjacent rooms).
This way you can meet and socialize with people in the same boat as you.

## Checklist

* Deal with [administrative formalities](/first/admin) to get a residence permit.
* Get [health insurance](/life/insurance) within 3Â months, and it must be back-dated to cover you from your first day in Switzerland.
* If you have a foreign driver's license, [exchange it for a Swiss one](/life/transportation#exchanging-a-foreign-drivers-license) within 12 months.
* If you are a fellowship student, find a professor for a [semester project](/first/projects) as soon as possible.
* Pass a "depth course" with a grade of at least 5 out of 6 within your first PhD year,
  i.e., a [course](/middle/courses) marked as such on the [EDIC website](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-course-book/).
  * If you did a Masters at EPFL or ETH, you do not have to do this, talk to EDIC about it.
* [Be a TA](/middle/ta) starting your second semester, so it's a good idea to ask your advisor and to look around for a course you'd enjoy TAing.
* Pass a [candidacy exam](/first/candidacy) at the end of your first year.

## Where to ask for help

In general, you can always talk to
your buddy for personal assistance,
your contact person or advisor for academic questions,
the EDIC staff for administrative questions,
and of course the student representatives.

You may also want to check out the "getting started" websites of
the [EPFL IC doctoral school](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-new-phd-students/),
the [EPFL-wide doctoral school](http://phd.epfl.ch/new-students),
and the [EPFL student affairs](https://www.epfl.ch/education/studies/en/).
