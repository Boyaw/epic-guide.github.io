Welcome! You just arrived in Lausanne, what's next?

In your first year, you will get used to doing research, and are not expected to be fully productive yet. In most fields, you will probably not publish a paper in your first year.
It's all about showing that you _can_ do it.
Depending on your lab, you may or may not have an office yet, but you should anyway hang out in the common room ([INR 012](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==INR%20012) and adjacent rooms).
This way you can meet and socialize with people in the same boat as you.

## Time limits

Some tasks have a time limit that you should be aware of:
* You must announce your arrival to the commune within a few days of your arrival: 8 days for Ecublens, 14 days for Lausanne, may be shorter or longer for others.
  * As part of this, you will get a "B permit" if you are not a Swiss permanent resident, whose exact details depend on which country you're a national of.
  * You must do this in the commune you live in, not another one, and you may have to renew it every year or every five years depending on your situation.
* You must get [health insurance](/life/insurance) within 3 months, and it must be back-dated to cover you from your first day in Switzerland.
* If you have a foreign driver's license, you must [exchange it for a Swiss one](/life/transportation#exchanging-a-foreign-drivers-license) within 12 months.
* You must pass a "depth course" with a grade of at least 5 out of 6 within your first PhD year, i.e., a [course](/middle/courses) marked as such on the [EDIC website](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-course-book/)
  * If you did a Masters at EPFL or ETH, you do not have to do this, talk to EDIC about it.
* You must [be a TA](/middle/ta) starting your second semester, so it's a good idea to ask your advisor and to look around for a course you'd enjoy TAing

## Where to ask for help

In general, you can always talk to
your buddy for personal assistance,
your contact person or advisor for academic questions,
the EDIC staff for administrative questions,
and of course the student representatives.

You may also want to check out the "getting started" websites of
the [EPFL IC doctoral school](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-new-phd-students/),
the [EPFL-wide doctoral school](http://phd.epfl.ch/new-students),
and the [EPFL student affairs](https://www.epfl.ch/education/studies/en/).
