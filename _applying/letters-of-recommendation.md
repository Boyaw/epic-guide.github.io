Letters of recommendation are required for most positions above internships, and sometimes even for internships.
They are by far the most important component of your application, but you do not have full control over them since they are written by others.

Typically, you will be asked for the names and emails of your references, and these references will be directly asked for a letter,
ensuring that they can speak freely since you cannot see the contents of the letter.
Always use institutional emails for your references, such as university or company emails.
Giving a reference's personal email may jeopardize your application since readers cannot tell if the email was genuine or if you wrote the letter yourself and sent it from a fake email.

Unfortunately, academic expectations for letters of recommendation in top universities often do not match what many people think of as a letter of recommendation.
For instance, a letter writer may genuinely believe they are writing a very strong letter, yet their letter could be perceived as weak by academic readers.
Thus, if your references have not helped people get into top universities before, you should share the second part of this page with them, so that they know what to write.


## Asking for letters

You will typically need 3 references for a PhD position, which should be people who have worked with you.
In practice, most people have not done research with 3 advisors before starting a PhD.
It's acceptable to have one or even two letters from people who merely taught a course you got a good grade in,
or people who worked with you outside of an academic context.

You should email people who you would like a reference from by asking them whether they can write "a strong letter of recommendation",
which is wording that allows them to easily say no rather than write a weak letter that could doom your application.
For people who only taught a class you did well in, there is no need to ask for a "strong" letter unless you had lots of interaction with them,
and you can even explicitly tell them that you already have strong letters from people you worked with but need this additional letter to reach 3 letters.

In your email, include:
- an introduction of who you are to remind them, unless you have worked with them recently
- a list of the accomplishments that you suggest they can include in the letter
- your CV and grades transcript, as well as a draft of your statement of purpose if you already have one

Letters of recommendation take time to write, and professors are often busy, so you should start months in advance to give them time, and make them aware of the deadline.
Remind them one month before the deadline, then two weeks, and more as the deadline draws closer. This is not considered rude as long as you are polite.

One way to help your references keep track of what they have to do is to create an online spreadsheet with rows for references and columns for the places you need a letter for.
You can then share this sheet with your references and ask them to put an 'X' in the corresponding cell when they're done, which lets you track who did what and who needs reminding.


## Writing a letter

Someone asked you for a letter of recommendation, and you want to help that person by maximizing the impact your letter has? Great!

Your main goal is to provide useful and detailed information about the candidate that you back up with evidence.
A short letter, especially one filled with platitudes such as "X is an enthusiastic and quick learner, and I enjoyed working with them, they would be a great fit for your program", is useless.

You should be honest in your assessment of the candidate's skills and tactful when presenting the candidate's weaknesses.
Do not, ever, lie. If you are found to have lied, for instance after a committee meets the candidate in person,
or after people read different letters you have written over the years that contradict each other, nobody will believe your letters.
If you do not believe you can honestly write a supportive letter, you should reject the request.

Start the letter by presenting the candidate and explaining how and how well you know them.
Immediately give a summary of your recommendation, including the specific position you are recommending for.
If you are in a position to make an offer to the candidate yourself, state that you will do so, or explain why you cannot,
which could be due to funding, a decision by the candidate to change locations, or any other good reason.

Summarize your qualifications to write the letter. Are you an expert in the field the candidate is interested in?
Do you have a degree from an institution comparable to the one the candidate is appying to?
Make this part short, though, the letter is not about you.

List the candidate's strengths, and justify them with detailed explanations.
For instance, if you gave the candidate a specific project, detail what happened and why you believe this reflects well on the candidate.
In particular, describe what the candidate did that sets them apart from others. Did they achieve results others couldn't?
Were they particularly active in meetings? Did they go the extra mile on their own initiative?
Do other members of your group go to the candidate for advice on writing, or presentation, or any other skill?
This part can be long if necessary. It's perfectly acceptable for the letter to use more than one page. Show, don't tell.

Compare the candidate with others, especially if you can give specifics.
For instance, you can compare the candidate's skills with that of past students who went to the kind of institution the candidate is applying to.
You can also compare the candidate with yourself, if they obtained results that you could not or had ideas that you did not think of.

If the candidate is not a native English speaker and you are in a position to judge their English skills, do so.
Even merely saying that meetings were conducted in English and the candidate's English level was never an issue is better than no information.
