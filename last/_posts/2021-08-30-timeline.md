1. If your suggested date of the private defence in ISA is 01.MM.YYYY, you have to have your private defence by the end of the month MM (in the year YYYY). Otherwise you need to ask for the extension. It’s OK to ask for less than half a year extension, but it’s probably good to have a clear picture why you need exactly 3.14 months extension ;) 
1. You have to hand in (electronically) your thesis 5 weeks before the private defence, so you have your final deadline only after you fill in jury proposal
1. This version is not final, but must contain an abstract in some Swiss language, your CV and other annoying things. If you don’t speak any such language, ask your friends/colleagues, there’s always someone willing to translate an abstract.
1. If your defence is successful you have one month applying any corrections the jury had
1. If not, I think it’s 6 months and then you repeat the defence, I’m not sure?
1. Your public defence can be any time (up to 6 months) after your private one (given you have passed the private one)
1. For non-EU people it may make sense to look for a job before your public defense, to avoid worries about your permit expiring
1. It seems that there is not so much work between the defences, but you might have corrections from the jury to apply and the presentation to prepare, so having it the next day might not be ideal ;)
