## Grocery

* Migros: If you’re not worried about your shopping data being exploited, the Cumulus program is free and does end up saving you significant money if you shop at Migros regularly (~ 1% of all purchases given back as vouchers).
* Denner
* Coop: Their “Supercard” is the same idea as Migros, though you only get the money back either on specific random days of the year when you can pay with “points”, or if you use their app in which case you can convert 1000 points = 10chf. They frequently have vouchers for free points though (e.g. “400 points if you spend over 40chf”)
* Manor (more expensive)
* Aligro: This is the closest to a restaurant supply store that you (a non-restaurant person) can get. Some of the stuff is worth it, some not; they have a wide variety of certain things and a weird lack of other things. You can check their current sales (2000/week) on aligro.ch (don’t forget to go into the filter and uncheck the “main sales only” box). Surprisingly, their website only has the sales, so if you want to know what they have you must either go there or watch the sales page for some weeks in a row.

## Furniture
* IKEA: If furnishing an entire apartment, it’s possible to go to IKEA, make a list of all the furniture you need, drop the list at the entrance and get everything delivered.
* Conforama: Just don’t. Very poor quality. Go to IKEA instead.

## Online shops
* There’s no such thing as amazon.ch, but [amazon.fr](https://amazon.fr) and [amazon.de](https://amazon.de) do ship most of their items (sometimes even with free shipping).
* [Digitec](https://digitec.ch) and [Galaxus](https://galaxus.ch) (same company, it’s just a branding thing)
* [Qoqa.ch](https://www.qoqa.ch/) has a few special offers every day. Once or twice per year, they have a very cheap offer for phone & internet subscriptions (typically the weeks before Christmas).

Be careful with customs duties on packages coming from outside of Switzerland:
* Free / exempted if value of the package is under CHF 60
* Otherwise, some rate (maybe it’s the Swiss VAT at 7.7%) + a fixed administration fee charged by the transporter (e.g. CHF 20).
* On the other hand, you can get foreign VAT reimbursed, which is typically higher than the Swiss VAT

## Second-hand marketplaces
The second-hand market in Switzerland often has surprisingly good deals.
* Ricardo
* Anibis
* Facebook Marketplace
* Facebook group for EPFL
