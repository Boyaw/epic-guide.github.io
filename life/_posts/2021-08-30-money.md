## Pay
The pay for PhD students is set at the federal level. As of 2021, it is 52,400 CHF/year for the first year, and increases by 1,000 CHF/year in each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years. ([source](https://inside.epfl.ch/internalhr/fr/prestationsrh/salaires/forfaits/))

There is one slightly unusual factor to take into account: the 13th salary.
The 13th salary system means that your salary is split into 13 and you get 1/13th each month,
with the last 1/13th being given to you partly in November and partly in December.
The origins of this system are historically not so clear, but nowadays it’s basically a way for you to pay for Christmas presents and such.

Overall, expect to get around 3,200 CHF/month after all taxes starting in the first year, plus the 13th salary. Here's an example breakdown for a first year monthly PhD salary **as of September 2017** (the amounts will have slightly changed since then):
This is from a non-November/December months, in those months it would be more due to the 13th salary mentioned above.

| Gross salary             | 3,930.80 CHF |
| First pillar (AHV/AVS)   | -201.45 CHF  |
| Various other deductions | -88.15 CHF   |
| Second pillar (Publica)  | -137.10 CHF  |
| Income tax               | -279.50 CHF  |
| **Net income**               | **3,224.60 CHF** |


## First pillar
Mandatory retirement savings, taken out of the salary, as a global pool for everyone. Called “AVS”. Equivalent to “social security”.

## Second pillar
Mandatory retirement savings, taken out of the salary, for yourself. Provider is always [Publica](https://publica.ch/) for EPFL employees.
Money is blocked until retirement or “permanently” leaving the country.

## Third pillar
Optional retirement savings for yourself. The money contributed to the Pillar 3a can be deducted from income for tax purposes. Capped to about CHF 7000 per year (the exact amount increases slightly every year). You can view this as an investment with a guaranteed ~ 15% return since you put in 7k/year and get ~ 1k/year less tax as a result.

Money is blocked until retirement, “permanently” leaving the country, buying a house or starting to work as an independent. At withdrawal, a progressive tax rate is applied depending on the capital amount and your canton of residence. ([source](https://finpension.ch/en/capital-withdrawal-tax-compared/))

You get to choose where you invest, so it can be a near-zero-return but safe option (e.g. 100% cash), or up to 100% in stocks with e.g. some of VIAC or PostFinance 3rd pillar options. 
Make sure you compare fees before choosing a solution: keeping it in cash should be free everywhere, but if you want to invest, your bank’s offering probably won’t be the cheapest.

In general, it’s not worth it to subscribe to a joint life insurance / third pillar product (a.k.a. “Pillar 3b”), even though salespeople may try to convince you otherwise.


## Taxes

If you have a B permit, do not have special tax deductions such as a 3a pillar, your net worth is lower than 50,000 CHF, and your yearly income is lower than 120,000 CHF, you do not need to do anything for taxes.
You are taxed at the source, i.e., the correct tax amount is taken directly from your salary.

If you have a B permit but do not meet the criteria above, typically because you put money in a 3a pillar, you must request an "ulterior ordinary taxation", or "taxation ordinaire ultérieure" in French.
The form to demand one is on the [Vaud website](https://www.vd.ch/themes/etat-droit-finances/impots/pour-les-employeurs/impot-a-la-source/personnes-imposees-a-la-source-sourciers/).
This only needs to be done once; you then fall into the next category.

If you have to file your taxes, typically because you requested so (above) or because you are Swiss, you will receive a letter at the start of the next year with informations.
You then need to file your taxes using [VaudTax](https://www.vd.ch/themes/etat-droit-finances/impots/impots-pour-les-individus/remplir-ma-declaration-dimpot/prestation-vaudtax/), a website which is basically a giant form.
You will have to declare your income and wealth by copying data from your salary certificate (available on sesame2.epfl.ch) and other documents such as bank statements, health insurance costs, and 3a pillar amounts.
Note that when declaring 3a pillar and health insurance costs, those should be under "insurance". The "rents and pensions" part of the form should most likely be completely blank.
Don't forget to declare your travel distance to work and the number of days you had lunch outside of home, these provide deductions.
For a PhD student putting the maximum amount of money in the 3a pillar, the computed tax amount should be around 3,500 CHF. If it's significantly more than that, you likely filled a field wrong.
After a little delay, a taxation decision will be made and you get refunded or charged depending on whether the monthly installments you've already paid (from your salary, for those taxed at source, or explicitly for others) were too much or too little.


## Bank accounts
Go with whichever Swiss bank you want, they’re all more or less equal, and will have free accounts for students. The main question is whether you want a more traditional account or an app-based one like CSX or Yuh.
If you are a US citizen, the process will be more complex due to Swiss banks having to report your data to the US.

Switzerland as a whole is in the process of moving away from Maestro for debit cards and towards Debit MasterCard/Visa, but until that is finished (2022?) depending on your bank you may need to get a credit card just so you can do online shopping, without actually using the credit part. Generally, it’s possible to pay for almost everything by card (cashless).

Do not expect any yields from non-investment bank accounts, even the savings ones, due to negative interest rates on CHF

## Checks
Don’t. It is possible to cash checks, but this has large fees, because nobody uses them in Switzerland.

## Transferring money to & from abroad
While it is possible to make a direct bank transfer from anywhere to Switzerland, that could result in large transfer and currency conversion fees. A cheaper way is to use a service such as [Wise](https://wise.com/) (formerly Transferwise), where fees are small and known upfront.

Wise and Revolut both offer payment cards that can be used in any country and for online shopping with cheap / free currency conversion.

## Interesting discounts for PhDs
One of the advantages of the PhD status is that you still are a student! Beyond staying at university, this also means that you can claim discounts in many different stores and restaurants.
