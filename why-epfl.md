# Why EPFL? Why EDIC?

## Differences from US universities
* The salary of a PhD student is more than enough to live, well above the poverty line.
* There are no real qualifying exams; within the first year, you need to pass a “depth” course of your choice and an oral exam called “candidacy exam”. This exam is mostly about finding an advisor who wants to work with you.
* Undergrads do (small) research projects as part of their studies, which PhD students frequently supervise, giving you the potential to have “minions” to do your bidding.
* Your PhD has a hard limit of 6 years, though most people finish in a shorter time, you cannot prolong it further than 6 (without getting tenure ;) ).
* You only get a PhD, there is no “intermediate” Masters degree or such. Undergrads (BSc) at EPFL almost all continue to a subsequent Master’s degree program, followed by a PhD.
* You have to do 18 course credits (EU ECTS) in total in your EDIC PhD, which corresponds to 4 courses (i.e. 1 depth, 2 breadth courses, and 1-2 seminars) of 6h/week each.
* You will have to TA a course every semester except the first and last, which is <20% of your total workload but gives you experience in teaching. This does not explicitly give you pay; the TA pay is a part of your normal salary.
* There are no tuition fees. All of your salary is yours.
* Switzerland is a very stable country whose politics are rather boring; you can be assured that your PhD will finish without political turmoil.
* You will commute to EPFL by foot or public transport, unless you absolutely want to use a car. While having a car can be convenient, it is not a necessity at all.
