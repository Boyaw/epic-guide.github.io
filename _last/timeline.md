In summary, you need to:
- Write your thesis
- Find a jury
- Schedule your private defense
- Pass your private defense
- Finalize your thesis
- Schedule your public defense
- Hold your public defense


## Scheduling your private defense

Once you have a [jury](/last/jury) you and your advisor are happy with, find a date they're all available for.
Your external examiners can be remote, you will need to discuss with them whether they want to come in person or not.

Keep in mind that:
- You must upload the final version of your thesis and the names of your jury 5 weeks before your private defense
- If your suggested date of the private defense in ISA is 01.MM.YYYY, you have to have your private defence by the end of the month MM in the year YYYY.
  Otherwise you need to ask for an extension. It’s OK to ask for less than half a year extension.
- As of 2024, it's better not graduate in September if you feel you are on track for dissertation awards.
  The EDIC committee says that it makes you ineligible for certain external awards. Graduating in August or in October are fine!

## Scheduling your public defense

You need to do all of the following:
- Ensure your jury president has gotten all jury members to sign the necessary forms.
- Upload the final version of your thesis, with any corrections the jury requested, at most 2 weeks before you want to have your public defense.
- Get your advisor to approve the final version of your thesis you uploaded.
- Review the request the student services will send you confirming the exact details of your thesis.
- If you want your public defense earlier than 4 weeks after the private defense, email the student services to confirm they're OK with your choice of date.
- Book a [room](/middle/epfl-infrastructure) for your defense.
- Find a caterer for the apéro after the defense.
- Announce your defense to the student services using a form they will send you after your advisor has approved the final version of your thesis.
- Announce your defense to your family, friends, and colleagues.
- Review the test print the EPFL printing center will make of your thesis.
- Fetch your diploma once the student services tell you it's ready.

## Other concerns

For non-EU people it may make sense to look for a job before your public defense, to avoid worries about your permit expiring.

It is up to your supervisor how long you contract will last.
In most cases, your contract can be extended a month or more after you finish your PhD.
You can then help younger PhDs and search for a job comfortably.
However, EPFL only require that you are paid until your _private_ defense, so you might want to discuss that with your supervisor. 

After your public defense, you will have access to your EPFL email for another six months, but not to employee services such as the SESAME portal.

Make sure you get back the CAMIPRO balance on your card (there's an online form to request a bank transfer).
