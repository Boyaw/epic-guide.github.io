Thinking about a PhD, or perhaps a research internship? This section is for you!

Unfortunately, most applications get rejected because they do not provide enough information to make an informed decision.
That is, people who read the applications cannot tell whether the applicant would be a good match, because the application contains too much noise and not enough signal.
This guide is all about maximizing the amount of useful information your application contains, so that you can stand out and be evaluated fairly.

Remember that **applying for a CS PhD at EPFL is entirely free and online**.
If you're preparing application materials anyway, and you think EPFL is a good option, there are no downsides to applying!
If you are still doing an undergrad, how about [the Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) internship program?
