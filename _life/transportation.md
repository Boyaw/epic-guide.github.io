Switzerland generally has excellent public transport in the form of trains and buses, meaning you do not need a car.
However, you may want to get a bike depending on where you live, and may still want to own or rent a car if you frequently need to go to areas poorly served by public transport.


## Public transport

Public transport in Switzerland is managed by SBB/CFF/FFS at the federal level, and by public agencies in each town or canton.

You should always have a valid ticket, even though you do not need one to enter buses or trains, as you are very likely to be controlled and will pay a large fine if you have no ticket.

EPFL provides PhD students with a free "half-fare" card, which is good because the full fare is really more of a "tourist tax".
Get yours as soon as possible; more information [here](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/services/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CFF_2019AvantageMobiliteFRAANG.pdf).

In general, the easiest option to buy a ticket is to get the SBB app and use its "EasyRide" feature: swipe to check in, swipe to check out,
and at the end of the day the app computes the cheapest ticket corresponding to your route and bills you.
(The computation is retroactive, thus for instance two trips in the same day might be "combined" into one trip using a ticket with a longer validity period that ends up being cheaper overall)

If you use the bus/metro around Lausanne often, get a travel pass, which EPFL subsidizes; see [here](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/mobility/public-transport/mobilis-subsidy/).

If you are under 25, you may be interested in the [SBB seven25 Travelcard](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/seven25-travelcard.html),
which allows people under 25 to enjoy unlimited travel anywhere in Switzerland from 7pm to 5am for only 390 CHF/year.

If you know which exact train you will get in advance, such as when going to the airport on vacation, the SBB website sells "super saver" tickets that are considerably cheaper
but need to be bought in advance and only work for one specific trip at one specific hour.
There is also a [saver day pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets-for-switzerland/day-pass/saver-day-pass.html).

Your "commune" (city) also likely sells a few daily passes per day at reduced rates, see their website, e.g., [this one](https://www.ecublens.ch/services/guichet-en-ligne/cartes-journalieres-cff) for Écublens.

If you're going skiing, the "magic pass" [includes some transport discounts](https://www.fribourgregion.ch/en/la-gruyere/news/magic-pass-lance-le-magic-travel/).


## Bike

If you need a bike, [Point Vélo](https://developpement-durable.epfl.ch/bike-center) sells new and second-hand bikes. They also perform repairs and teach free mechanics courses.

[PubliBike](https://developpement-durable.epfl.ch/publibike-en) is a bike sharing service that works at EPFL and generally around the area.

There is plenty of [bike parking around EPFL](https://developpement-durable.epfl.ch/bike-parking).


## Car

If you want to come to EPFL by car, parking rules can be found [here](https://parking.epfl.ch/homepage).

You have access to [the car sharing service Mobility](http://www.mobility.ch/) through EPFL, with discounts. See [here](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/mobility/vehicles/mobility-carsharing/).

You can also get special discounts with Europcar with a Camipro; see [here](https://support.epfl.ch/epfl?id=epfl_kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014917&sys_kb_id=921965341b1be0d0df3341588b4bcb5a).
