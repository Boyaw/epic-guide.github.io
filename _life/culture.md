## Languages

Switzerland is mostly divided in three cultural parts by language: German, French, and Italian.
Most "cantons", Switzerland's equivalent of states, speak German; a few in the west speak French; and one, Ticino, speaks Italian.
Some parts of Graubünden in the east speak Romansh, Switzerland's fourth official language.

What is important to know is that while we refer to the Swiss-German part as Swiss-"German", Swiss-German ("Schwitzerdütsch") as a language is quite different from the German spoken in Germany.

And in the same way there are some small language differences between the French spoken in France and in the regions around Lausanne.
These differences are much smaller than between German and Swiss-German but they can still cause some confusion such as whether you are having lunch (déjeuner in France/dîner in Switzerland) or dinner. 

## Recycling

Switzerland takes recycling seriously.

There are separate paper/cardboard, glass, and compost bins are available for every building.
Bins for PET, HDPE, batteries, and lightbulbs are available at every grocery store.
Bins for oil, aluminum/cans, and clothes are available at specific locations, such as outside big grocery stores.

"Normal" trash uses special, taxed trash bags in Vaud. You _cannot_ use a black bag for this, you must buy a roll of trash bags, e.g. 10x35l is CHF 20.
You have to explicitly ask a cashier for them while you're paying, they are not available on shelves.
(Introvert pro tip: the exception is Aligro, which has them just before the cashiers, if you don't feel like asking.)

## Sunday

Sunday is a rest day in Switzerland. That means that most supermarkets & shops are closed. There are still gas stations and small family-run shops open or supermarkets in train stations.

Your neighbours will expect you not to do the laundry, use the vacuum cleaner, throw out the glass bin, or drill holes into your walls on Sundays.
It's OK to still do it once in a while, but at least try to do it in the afternoon rather than the morning.

## Other things to note

Punctuality is not a joke. Even for social events like dinners you are expected to be on time or slightly earlier. Conversely, it also means public transport is very on time.

Try to keep the noise down in house parties or reunions, especially after 22h00. It is a thoughtful idea to let your neighbors know ahead of time if you are hosting a large party.
